Harvester Conveyor
==========================

Harvester Conveyor is a load balancing controller. Combined with other components like Kube-vip and Harvester CCM, it makes Harvester a cloud provider.
Users can deploy Harvester Conveyor in any other Kubernetes clusters without dependency on Harvester.

## Manifests and Deploying
The ./manifests folder contains useful YAML manifests to use for deploying and developing the Harvester Conveyor. This simply YAML creates a Deployment using the rancher/harvester-conveyor container.

## Current status
This is in the pre-alpha stage of the development.
